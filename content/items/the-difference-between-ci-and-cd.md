> **A good CI build:**
> - Ensures no code that breaks basic stuff and prevents other team members to work is introduced to the main branch
> - Is fast enough to provide feedback to developers within minutes to prevent context switching between tasks



> **A good CD build:**
> - Ensures that as many features as possible are working properly
> - The faster the better, but it is not a matter of speed. A 30-60 minutes build is OK
